# CodeWars 7kyu Katas
This repository serves as a collection of my solutions for CodeWars 7kyu katas. CodeWars is a platform that provides coding challenges and katas to help developers sharpen their programming skills.

# Project Description
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my problem-solving skills and provide solutions to various 7kyu-level katas. Each kata includes a description of the problem and my corresponding solution/solutions.

# Kata Structure
Each kata is organized in the following manner:

### Kata Description: A clear and concise description of the problem statement, requirements, and expected outputs.
### Solution: My implementation of the kata, providing a step-by-step approach to solving the problem. Each solution is well-documented and includes relevant explanations and any assumptions made during the implementation.

# Usage
Feel free to explore the katas, read the problem descriptions, and examine my solutions. You can browse the repository to find katas that interest you or focus on specific areas of coding challenges.

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are currently not open, as it is meant to showcase my personal solutions. However, if you have suggestions, alternative approaches, or improvements to any of the katas, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to discuss.
